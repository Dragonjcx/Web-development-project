        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Jaccari, and I am a sophomore at Kennesaw State University. I used to major in computer game design and development but before my sophomore year started, I switched to information technology. Working with computers and technology is something I was always interested in, and I am excited about what I’ve been able to do, and what I will be able to do in the future.</p>
        <p>In terms of experience, I have taken many coding classes at KSU. During my first year, I learned about many different coding languages, and even did a little bit of python. I did C# for a little bit, and now I am back to doing python. I would like to learn more about coding, and I don’t think I am at my highest when it comes to that.</p>
        <p>There are many things I hope to achieve in the programming world. As I mentioned earlier, computers and technology are something I often interact with. Video games are one of my biggest hobbies, and recently, I’ve been doing some digital art. I think there are a lot of cool things coding allows you to do, and I want to be able to reach the level where I can do a lot of those things. I want to be able to fully understand code and create many different things. When I graduate, I want to get a job involving working with computers and translate what I’ve learned.</p>
